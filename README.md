DSML Capstone Project - README
**Project Title**: Electric Vehicle Population Analysis & Classification
**Dataset**: Washington State Electric Vehicle Population Dataset
**Objective**: Analyze and predict the type of electric vehicle (BEV or PHEV) using various features
such as make, model year, MSRP, and electric range.
--------------------------------------------------
**Phase 1: Problem Definition**
- Identified business objective: Predict electric vehicle type (BEV or PHEV)
- Chose classification as the modeling task
**Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Excel)**
- Cleaned and standardized columns
- Removed missing and duplicate rows
- Transformed inconsistent values
- Generated 'cleaned' Excel file for further analysis
**Phase 3: Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)**
- Created KPIs: Total EVs, EVs by County, Top Manufacturers
- Used bar charts, pie charts, line graphs for trend analysis
- Built interactive dashboard with dropdown slicers
**Phase 4: Model Building & Performance Evaluation (Python)**
- Used Jupyter Notebook and scikit-learn
- Preprocessed data: feature selection, encoding, train-test split
- Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
- Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- Visualized distribution, correlations, confusion matrix, and accuracy comparison
**Tools Used**:
- Excel for data cleaning
- Power BI for dashboarding
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn) for modeling
**Final Deliverables**:
- Cleaned Excel dataset
- Power BI dashboard
- Python model notebook (.ipynb)
